# SQL_Hackerrank_Project
> In this project, I solved multiple SQL challenges on Hackerrank. This involved querying databases and getting the required datasets, tables and information from them. Some of the query syntax used includes:

- **SELECT**
- **FROM**
- **WHERE**
- **BETWEEN**
- **AND**
- **OR**
- **GROUP BY**
- **ORDER BY**

To mention but a few.


> I also used **_JOIN_** to query multiple dataframes, and got information from them using their primary keys. 
- **LEFT JOIN**
- **RIGHT JOIN**
- **INNER JOIN**
- **FULL JOIN**
